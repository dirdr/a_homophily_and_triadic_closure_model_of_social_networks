## About 🔎

The project presents a generative model of social network formation based on two fundamental sociological mechanisms: homophily and triadic closure. The model simulates the formation of social networks that exhibit key structural properties observed in real-world networks, such as high clustering coefficients, positive assortativity, and low density.

Empirical validation is performed using a high school friendship network dataset, demonstrating the model's ability to generate networks that closely mirror real social structures.
